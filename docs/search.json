    "text": "3.9 Summary of differences between OLS and QR\nOLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals, and QR minimizes the sum of absolute valued residuals. This leads to differing results when placing the regression line. OLS will place the line between the arithmetic mean of all the points, but QR will place its regression line through the median of all of the points. In other words, given an input of the 50th quantile, QR regression will place the regression line in such a way that half of the points will be above the regression line and half will be below the regression line. In general, given an input of the \\(\\theta^{th}\\) quantile, QR will place a regression line so that \\(\\theta\\) percentage of points will be below the regression line. This allows QR has some interesting benefits. Although OLS is generally better for normally distributed data, QR performs relatively well with normally distributed data as well. However, one of the biggest charms of QR is that it can be used on non-normally distributed data. Since QR allows statisticians to look at the behavior across the entire distribution, rather than just fixating on the mean. With QR, one can see at what intervals the model breaks down or excels. This allows a model to be fine-tuned ### Mean absolute error\nThe mean absolute error (MAE) is the average magnitude of the errors of the values predicted by the regression and the actual observed values for the response variable. Because it is a simple average, all errors have the same weight, there are no penalties for different magnitude deviations [2]. MAE assumes that the errors are normally distributed, if the error distribution was non-normal, the average may not be a good measure of centrality and can paint a false picture of the goodness-of-fit of the regression curve. MAE also assumes that the errors are unbiased. While the average magnitude of the errors is expected to be non-zero (unless the regression is a perfect fit) the average of the residuals, i.e., the deviation of the predicted value from the actual value, considering underestimation and overestimation. This means on average the regression curve does not over or underestimate.\n\\[\n\\text { MAE }=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left|y_i-\\hat{y}_i\\right|=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left|e_i\\right|\n\\]\n\n3.9.1 Root mean squared error\nIt calculates the differences between the predictions and the actual observations (residuals) and then gets their quadratic mean for each. This type of error gives a larger penalty for larger errors [2]. This error also assumes that the errors are unbiased and that they follow a normal distribution. This gives a picture of the size of residuals in comparison to the regression line.\n\\[\n\\operatorname{RMSE}=\\sqrt{\\operatorname{MSE}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2}\n\\]\n\n\n3.9.2 Variance of error\nIt is a measure of how spread all the errors are from the mean of all errors.\n\\[\n\\operatorname{Var}(e)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(e_i-\\bar{e})^2\n\\]\n\n\n3.9.3 Min/max error\nA measure of the maximum residual for a prediction and the minimum residual.\n\\[\nf: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\text {, if }(\\forall e \\in X_{error}) f\\left(e_i\\right) \\geq f(e)\n\\]\n\\[\nf: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\text {, if }(\\forall e \\in X_{error}) f\\left(e_i\\right) \\leq f(e)\n\\]"

    "text": "4.3 Interpretation of betas\nOf all the house shapes, irregular house shape 1, IR1, seems to have the most least negative impact. Except near the highest quantiles, the impact of IR2 on the price of houses was about 5000 dollars less than that of IR1. Furthermore, there was very little difference between IR3 and IR1. IR3 only made a difference near the lower quantiles where it added between 40-60k in price.\nThe foundation variables also had some interesting behavior. Stone had a parabolic shape across the quantiles. Relative to brick, it’s effect on price was very high at the lower quantiles, hit it’s lowest point at the 60th quantile, and then began to increase after the 60th quantile. Furthermore, relative to brick, wood foundations had an almost stepwise pattern. About every 20 quantiles, the price would jump upward and then decrease. This is perhaps due to the widely varying conditions that a wood foundation can come in. Lastly, relative to brick, concrete slab was the only beta foundation that consistently increased across all of the quantiles. It starts off at 40k near the lower end of the quantiles and increases to 120k near the upper end of the quantiles.\nAlthough lot shape and foundation had strange patterns, lot area and total rms above ground had a relatively expected pattern. They both increased positively and in a linear pattern across all the quantiles. Lot area started at around a 40 dollars at the lower quantiles and maxed out at around 120 at the upper quantiles. Furthermore RMS started at a dollar at the lower ends and maxed out at about 3 near the 90th quantile.\n\n4.3.1 OLS model\n\nols = lm(data=df, SalePrice ~ GrLivArea + LotArea + TotRmsAbvGrd + as.factor(LotShape) + as.factor(Foundation))\nols_summary = summary(ols)\nols_summary\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = SalePrice ~ GrLivArea + LotArea + TotRmsAbvGrd + \n    as.factor(LotShape) + as.factor(Foundation), data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-422488  -26194    -805   20461  326538 \n\nCoefficients:\n                              Estimate Std.

    "text": "3.5 Summary of OLS and QR\nOLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals, and QR minimizes the sum of absolute valued residuals. This leads to differing results when placing the regression line. OLS will place the line between the arithmetic mean of all the points, but QR will place its regression line through the median of all of the points. In other words, given an input of the 50th quantile, QR regression will place the regression line in such a way that half of the points will be above the regression line and half will be below the regression line. In general, given an input of the \\(\\theta^{th}\\) quantile, QR will place a regression line so that \\(\\theta\\) percentage of points will be below the regression line. This allows QR has some interesting benefits. Although OLS is generally better for normally distributed data, QR performs relatively well with normally distributed data as well. However, one of the biggest charms of QR is that it can be used on non-normally distributed data. Since QR allows statisticians to look at the behavior across the entire distribution, rather than just fixating on the mean. With QR, one can see at what intervals the model breaks down or excels."
