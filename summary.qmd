# Summary

1. Quantile regression offers the ability to customize regression line according to the value that we're predicting to get a more accurate result. (ex: Above 70% we use tau = 70).

2. Quantile regression's special lines with tau better representing the data we are predicting. And it performs better than just using OLS model on the whole data
3. Quantile regression re-evaluates significant variables at every tau, so for example significant variables at tau = 0.1 would probably be different from significant variables at tau = 0.9
4. Quantile regression performs better the more data we have
5. Quantile regression needs large computation power for calculating all possible tau values
