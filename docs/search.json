Because it is a simple average, all errors have the same weight, there are no penalties for different magnitude deviations [2]. MAE assumes that the errors are normally distributed, if the error distribution was non-normal, the average may not be a good measure of centrality and can paint a false picture of the goodness-of-fit of the regression curve. MAE also assumes that the errors are unbiased. While the average magnitude of the errors is expected to be non-zero (unless the regression is a perfect fit) the average of the residuals, i.e., the deviation of the predicted value from the actual value, considering underestimation and overestimation. This means on average the regression curve does not over or underestimate.\n\\[\n\\text { MAE }=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left|y_i-\\hat{y}_i\\right|=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left|e_i\\right|\n\\]\n\n\nRoot mean squared error\nIt calculates the differences between the predictions and the actual observations (residuals) and then gets their quadratic mean for each.

    "text": "Differences\nOLS regression minimizes the sum of squares of residuals, but QR minimizes the sum of weighted absolute errors. The idea behind this is if regression process underestimates or overestimates, the proportion of positive and negative residuals will shift. By using these weights, the bias of the model is reduced and the centrality of the model is able to be more accurately estimated.\nOLS only estimates the mean, but RQ estimates the conditional quantile. This allows RQ to perform estimates on different intervals of interest rather than just estimating the mean."
